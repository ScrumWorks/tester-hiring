# UserHub Demo

A simplified Next.js application for testing and QA evaluation. This demo app includes login, profile settings, and account management features.

## What You Need to Do

**Your task:** Write a comprehensive Playwright E2E test suite for this app and set up a CI pipeline to run tests on pull requests.

👉 **[See the full task description →](TASKS.md)**

The tasks document covers:
- **Required:** Login flow tests, profile settings tests, account settings tests, responsive & navigation tests
- **Bonus:** GitHub Actions CI pipeline, test infrastructure (fixtures, accessibility, tags)
- Submission instructions (branch, PR, local verification)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd tester-hiring
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   npm run test
   ```
   Tests will start the dev server automatically. If you already have the dev server running on port 3001, tests will reuse it.

## Test Credentials

Credentials are stored in `db.json` and can be changed via the app. Initial values:

- **Email:** `user@test.com`
- **Password:** `Password123`
